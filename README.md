### Android architecture
This project shows how to build and app using mvp. It provides
the basic infrastructure to handle multhithreading and errors.
The project doesnt use any DI framework, but can be used anyway.

The project is a sample that shows a list of notes, create notes
and remove notes.

Currently is under development.

Apply a clean design(SOLID principles) and avoid coupling to
framework or external libs. Also provide tests for show that this
implementation can be tested easily.

##### Todos:
*  Test: unit and infrastructure(database, usecase handler)
*  Improve stop use cases. Maybe use LiveData or Lyfecicles.
*  Comment code

##### Collaborations
